# herokusolochallenge

###Description

For this challenge spin up an entirely new project (repetition is key here and will be helpful I promise!). Set up a node project using npm init, create an http server and respond on port 3000 with “Hello world!”. Test the application locally in the browser.

Note: make sure you use `listen(process.env.PORT || 3000)`; in order to support heroku’s automatic port assignment.

Follow this tutorial to get heroku set up on your machine: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction

Once you are complete, post the assignment to both GitHub and Heroku.
